# Auction e-commerce in Python
This is an eBay-based application build in Python, with the framework Django.

## Motivation
This project was built for learning purposes, by demand of the course CS50W from HarvardX. In this course, I've learned the basics of Web Development using Python's Django framework and Javascript. On this project, I implemented the basics of Database-driven applications, using SQLite as my database. I've also used the Django-admin interface for making the interactions with the database and between tables more simple and faster.

## Tech/framework used
Built with:
* Python: version 3.8.5
* Django: version 3.1.3
* HTML
* CSS: Bootstrap framework
* Javascript: imported from Bootstrap
* SQLite database

## Installation
This project uses Python and Django. Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

## How to use?
After cloning the repository on your local machine, and with the resources properly installed, just run the server in the repository directory with:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
The application will be hosted on your local domain: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
### Use description 
On the application, you can create an account, log in, create items, make bids on items and build a wishlist with your favorite items.
The auctions are separate by categories, which ones you can filter and see only the matching items.
You can also make and see comments about items when logged in.
Feel free to run it on your computer and experiment with it!
